# ibm-hr-employee-attrition

Predicted the employee attrition for employee data from IBM HR department. I used feature selection to identify top 20 features impacting attrition from 35 given attributes and performed classification models using those top features. Got 96% accuracy from gradient boosting model. Some of the major contributors towards attrition were age, overtime, monthly income, stock options, and years at company.
